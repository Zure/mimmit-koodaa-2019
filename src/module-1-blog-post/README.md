## Module 1 - create blog post

This exercise should make you familiar with basic HTML elements such as `h1`, `h2` and `image`.

In react, writing HTML elements is quite similar to basic HTML document. Syntax for attributes is a bit different e.g. className vs class.

CSS can be applied directly to style attribute of the element or by referencing a className in .css file.
